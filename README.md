* 4 moves from Goh
* Implemented mirror match between those four moves
* Purely text based


P1 > p
P2 Lvl = L
P1 > p > miss
p tot = 27
p1 state change recovery for next 27 ticks
if p2s input exe < p1 tot ..continue evaluating

TOT, LVL, EXE, DMG, GRD implemented on 4 moves in a Goh mirror match
websockets for console input so me and ezra can play together
